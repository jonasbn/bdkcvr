Release 0.04 - Released Tue Mar 13 2007

- Fixed problem in t/critic.t, I had implemented a mix of my own and the
  recommended Perl::Critic test, so it gave unforseen test failures
  
  
Release 0.03 - Released Mon Mar 12 2007 Update not necessary

- Added Perl::Critic test, t/critic.t and related t/perlcriticrc

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part of the
  normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is set.
  
  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.


Release 0.02 - Released Wed Mar 1 2006 Update not necessary

- Added some more links to SEE ALSO section, apparently there is already a 
  module on CPAN capable of validating CVR numbers this module does not use
  the name CVR so I did no locate it prior to releasing this module to CPAN


Release 0.01 - Released Mon Feb 21 2006

- Initial version
