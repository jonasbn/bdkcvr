Changes file for Business-DK-CVR

$Id: Changes,v 1.7 2008-06-11 08:08:00 jonasbn Exp $

Release 0.06, Released Feb 2011 Update not necessary

- Added use of Params::Validate in key places and phased out use of Business::DK::PO

- Made control cifers Readonly

- The _length method has been removed, since it's use was obsoleted


Release 0.05 - Released Thu Nov  6 11:46:16 CET 2008 Update not necessary

- Add object oriented variant implementation [BDKCVR-1], introducing
  Class::Business::DK::CVR

- Added prerequisites test (Test::Prereq) [BDKCVR-2]

- Added requirement of Scalar::Util, we are stealing as much as we can from
  Michael Peters's distribution:
  
    Data::FormValidator::Constraints::DateTime

- Added a LICENSE file

- Added LICENSE file and split COPYRIGHT and LICENSE section in POD into 
  two separate sections

- Restructured tests files to follow namespace in directory structure

- Added recursive_test_files to Build.PL

- Added create_readme to Build.PL

- Introduced generate method so valid CVRs now can be generated randomly

- Introduced Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Business::DK::CVR, this is sort
  of an example application, it is however just a simple wrapper fitting into
  the Data::FormValidator::Constraints framework - it is should be usable, not
  just a demo, but still experimental


Release 0.04 - Released Tue Mar 13 2007 Update not necessary

- Fixed problem in t/critic.t, I had implemented a mix of my own and the
  recommended Perl::Critic test, so it gave unforseen test failures
  
  
Release 0.03 - Released Mon Mar 12 2007 Update not necessary

- Added Perl::Critic test, t/critic.t and related t/perlcriticrc

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part of the
  normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is set.
  
  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.


Release 0.02 - Released Wed Mar 1 2006 Update not necessary

- Added some more links to SEE ALSO section, apparently there is already a 
  module on CPAN capable of validating CVR numbers this module does not use
  the name CVR so I did no locate it prior to releasing this module to CPAN


Release 0.01 - Released Mon Feb 21 2006

- Initial version
