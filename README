DESCRIPTION
    CVR is a company registration number used in conjuction with VAT
    handling in Denmark.

  validate

    The function takes a single argument, a 10 digit CVR number.

    The function returns 1 (true) in case of a valid CVR number argument and
    0 (false) in case of an invalid CVR number argument.

    The validation function goes through the following steps.

    Validation of the argument is done using the functions (all described
    below in detail):

    _argument, exported by Business::DK::PO
    _content, exported by Business::DK::PO
    _length
    If the argument is a valid argument the sum is calculated by
    _calculate_sum based on the argument and the controlcifers array.

    The sum returned is checked using a modulus caluculation and based on
    its validity either 1 or 0 is returned.

  generate
