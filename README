DESCRIPTION
    CVR is a company registration number used in conjuction with VAT
    handling in Denmark.

    If you want to use this module in conjunction please check:
    Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Business::DK::CVR

SUBROUTINES AND METHODS
  validate
    The function takes a single argument, a 10 digit CVR number.

    The function returns 1 (true) in case of a valid CVR number argument and
    0 (false) in case of an invalid CVR number argument.

    If the argument is a valid argument the sum is calculated by
    _calculate_sum based on the argument and the controlcifers array.

    The sum returned is checked using a modulus caluculation and based on
    its validity either 1 or 0 is returned.

  validateCVR
    Better name for export. This is just a wrapper for "validate"

  generate
    Generate is a function which generates valid CVR numbers, it is by no
    means an authority, since CVRs are generated and distributed by danish
    tax authorities, but it can be used to generate example CVRs for testing
    and so on.

PRIVATE FUNCTIONS
  _calculate_sum
    This function takes an integer and calculates the sum bases on the the
    controlcifer array.

EXPORTS
    Business::DK::CVR exports on request:

    "validate"

    "_calculate_sum"

DIAGNOSTICS
    *   The amount requested exceeds the maximum possible valid CVRs 9090908

        The number of valid CVRs are limited, so if the user requests a
        number of CVRs to be generated which exceeds the upper limit, this
        error is instantiated. See: "generate".
